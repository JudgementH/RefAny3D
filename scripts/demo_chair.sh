    --prompt "Three-quarter front view of a vintage wooden-frame armchair with a tufted back and seat cushions covered in bold red, orange, and cream stripes, set in a warm, sunlit living room; diffusion-lit golden-hour ambiance, soft shadows, and a subtle rim light along the chair edges; honey-toned hardwood floor with a neutral beige rug; neutral warm walls; a low coffee table with a small stack of books and a potted plant, plus a floor lamp and a blurred bookshelf in the background to create depth; color palette harmonizes with the chair's stripes, ensuring the chair remains the focal point; use depth of field to softly blur the background while preserving texture of the fabric and wood." \
